"""
Specification-derived oracle for SysML-extracted neural controllers.

Derives correct action labels directly from the #NeuralRequirement AST —
no simulation, no propagationDelay, no lookahead. The requirement is a
static function from observations to actions; the oracle evaluates it.

Also extracts observation names, action names, and the input marked
`#Completion` from the SysML model.
